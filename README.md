# âš¡ Reflection

**I have gained a lot of knowledge from the industrial talk for UTMDigital as well as the System Development at Credence. The industrial visit at Indah Water was very eye-opening as I understood the usage of technology in maintaining a recycle water facility into drinkable water. PC Assembly assignment allows me to use real-world skills to operate on my own computer to clean and repair it. The industrial talks for making a report and poster has given me a much better thought of the career as IT or system analytic, where there are way more intriguing paths i can go for in future. Finally, the design thinking assignments have given me experience to work in a team and understand empathy, which is surprisingly important in implementing into a design of a solution. It has increased my knowledge in the fields of Software Engineering, especially behind the scenes of how software is planned, developed, and deployed.**
